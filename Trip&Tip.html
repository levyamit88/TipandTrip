<br/>Thailand (Thai: ประเทศไทย), historically known as Siam, officially the Kingdom of Thailand, is a country in Southeast Asia.
<br/>It is located at the centre of the Indochinese Peninsula, spanning 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), with a population of almost 70 million people.
<br/>It is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and Myanmar.
<br/>Thailand also shares maritime borders with Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast, and Indonesia and India (Andaman and Nicobar Islands) on the Andaman Sea to the southwest. 
<br/>Nominally, Thailand is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy; however, in recent history, its government has experienced multiple coups and periods of military dictatorships. 
<br/>Bangkok is the nation's capital and largest city.

<h3><u>Tip for Trip</u></h3>

<ol>
<li><b><u class="red">The best time to visit thailand</u></b></li>
<p>
<br/>The average temperature in Thailand is 30 degrees celsius, at all seasons.
<br/>There are monsoon storms all the time, but if you want to travel comfortably without too much sweating and without too much rain,
<br/>the best time to visit is during the dry, cool season between <b>November and early April</b> (winter months).
<br/>Our favorite time is March, because this month there are fewer tourists than in November-February, and the weather is perfect.

</p>
<li><b><u class="red">Its all about the money</u></b></li>
<p>
<br/>Thailand uses the Thai baht, and 1 Ils currently buys you roughly 10.8 Thai baht.
<br/>To check current rates, I like using XE currency converter.
<br/>They also have a good mobile app, which is handy to use while traveling.
<br/>Credit cards like Visa, Mastercard and American Express are widely accepted throughout the country at hotels, restaurants and big malls.
<br/>For one person, 15,000 Ils is enough for a month's vacation, including hotels, shopping, parties and domestic/international flights.

</p>
<li><b><u class="red">Where to go?</u></b></li>
<p>
<br/>Thailand boasts with rich culture, historic sights as well as scenic beauty from the mountains in the north to the beach in the south.
<br/>If you are a nature and animal lover, Northern Thailand is your place to be.
<br/>Go trekking, visit local villages, stuff your face with amazing food at the colourful markets and visit an Elephant sanctuary.
<br/>If you're a beach bum and you want to be swimming and island hopping all day long, Southern Thailand needs to be on your list.
<br/>For us, a month's vacation is divided into 2 parts: one week in northern Thailand and 3 weeks in the south.
<br/>In the north you can take a jeep trip called "thana" for 4 days, and in the next 3 dayes you can take a trip in the big cities.
<br/>The other 3 weeks, we like to spend in southern thailnd. There are many places to see and many things to do.
<br/>Parties, beaches, extremes, breathtaking views, are just a small part of the list.
<br/>

</p>
<li><b><u class="red">Pick What To Pack</u></b></li>
<p>
<br/>If you're planning to head to Northern Thailand to do some trekking in the mountains, waterproof hiking shoes and a light but wind and waterproof jacket will do wonders.
<br/>Add sunglasses, a good sunhat and reef-safe sunscreen and you are set for a holiday in the south.
<br/>Leave your valuables, jewellery and jeans at home, they truly don't belong to this trip.
<br/>On my last trip, I took a small bag, and put in it a first aid kit, a passport and equipment for two days: clothes, shampoo, toiletries and shoes.
<br/>For professionals: When I arrived in Thailand, I went shopping and bought equipment once a week for the next week ..
<br/>Thailand is very cheap, and you do not need more than that.
